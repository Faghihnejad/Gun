Firearm background checks from 1999 to 2021

Totals: This number represents the total number of firearm background checks initiated through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). "They do not represent the number of firearms sold. Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios, a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale." Although a one-to-one correlation cannot be made, but this statistic could be a good indicator of the number of firearms sold.

Population: Population of each state at a given year.

Totals per 1000: Total number of background checks per 1000 people.

Pres Election: How each state has voted in the presidential election. Results are valid for four years. For example, Arizona voted for Republican in 2016 and Democrat in 2020. Therefore, it would remain R from 2016 until 2019 and changes to D from 2020 to present. 1 is denoting Democrat and 0 is for Republican.

Sitting President: Party of the sitting president at any given time. 1 for D and 0 for R.

Mass Shooting: Data compiled from Stanford MSA database and TVP mass shooter database. It should be noted that each database use different criteria for the reported mass shooting. For 1999 to 2016, Stanford database is used and for 2016 to 2021 TVP data base is used to record time and state of each mass shooting. It should be noted that mass shooting victims represent a small fraction of casualties. 

MSpM: Number of mass shooting per 1,000,000 people.

Real GDP: Annual GDP of each state based on 2012 dollar. Data for 2021 is the average of the first two quarters.

GDP per capita: Annual GDP per capita of each state based on 2012 dollar.

Urban: Urban percentage of population for each state. For the years 1999–2009 data from year 2000 was used and for the years 2010–2021 data from year 2010 is used.
